    <h1>Band Kids: A Guide</h1>

    <p>The watered down definition: A "Band Kid" usually refers to a socially awkward kid who is usually in a band class or in the marching band.</p>
    <p>There are multiple types of Band Kids. Here is a guide on who to stay away from, who is okay, and who is safe to talk to.</p>

    <p>THE Band Kid.</p>
    <p>A reddit kid, some phrases they say “dat boi “smol bean” “oof” “do you watch call me carson?” Their whole personality is revolved around self depricating jokes and doing weird poses.</p>
    <p>This is someone that basically lives and breathes a certain selection of memes. These types of ‘memes’ are usually deep fried, t-pose, bruh, 🅱️, thicc, Soviet Russia, roblox oof sound, 🅱️eter griffin, big chungus, Alexa play despacito, liek if u cride, etc. ‘Band kids’ stereotypically like beating it to Pokimane, watching Call me Carson, playing Minecraft, listening to monstercat, watching Reddit text-to-speech videos, PewDiePie, and a bunch of other weird shit.</p>
    <p>Also known as the Reddit kid, band kids are defined by an obsession with Reddit, Pewdiepie, and gaming (particularly PC gaming and Nintendo switch), strange and awkward mannerisms, and a tendency to make weird poses, talk fast, and regurgitate old memes. They tend to also like anime and anime-related things (such as Pokemon games), and likely have an anime profile picture on their social networking accounts. Band kids are likely active on Discord and are often moderators on there and/or Reddit. They frequent r/pewdiepiesubmissions and r/dankmemes, and look down on those who use Instagram and TikTok as “normies.” This culture is common amongst kids in high school marching band (hence the name) but it is not limited to them. Band kid/Reddit kid culture may overlap with weeb culture and neckbeard culture, and is prominent amongst individuals beyond high school age. Think of the band kid as the neckbeard when they were in high school. Everyone knows at least 4 of these kids from high school.</p>

    <p>
        For example:<br>
        Band kid 1: <i>I just donated 500 dollars from my mom’s credit card to pokimane! keanu chungus wholesome 100 See you at band tomorrow!<br></i>

        Band kid 2: <i>I can’t make it tomorrow big oof I’m gonna be busy playing Smash Bros on my Nintendo switch epic gamer moment. Do you think my cat is big enough for r/chonkers?<br></i>

        Band kid 1: <i>bruh of course, you’ll be raking in the karma with that one soviet union national anthem<br></i>
